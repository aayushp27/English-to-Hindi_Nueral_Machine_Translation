# English-to-Hindi_Nueral_Machine_Translation
Nowadays there are more than 6000 spoken languages in the world. We can’t understand all of them, but we must involve with people who speak a different language because the society is growing globally.  Specifically, we must understand the detail of sentences properly when we chat with other people. Also we know that learning different languages are needed a lot of time. Deep learning is a powerful technique that can be used to solve this problem. In this project I’ll be building and comparing the LSTM model with GRU-Attention model and the model with the better performance will be enhanced.
